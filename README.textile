h2. Tags and parameters

h3. oui_vine vs oui_player

While the @<txp:oui_player />@ tag is able to embed any video from any extension-related provider, the @<txp:oui_vine />@ tag is a shortcut to embed Vine videos only. It is strictly equivalent to @<txp:oui_player provider="vine" />@.

Check the "oui_player":https://github.com/NicolasGraph/oui_player documentation for more informations.

h4. Recognised values for the @play@ attribute

* *ID*;
* http(s)://(www.)vine.co/v/[*ID*];
* *Name of a field* containing any of the above value.

When using the @oui_player@ tag (vs @oui_vine@), the right provider needs to be set if the @play@ value or its field related one is an ID. It is optional, but can fasten the rendering, if the value is an URL.

h4. Player customization

h5. Preferences vs attributes

While some player customization elements, related to the media to play, should be used through attributes, these used as global settings should preferrably be set through the plugin preferences to avoid a massive use of tag attributes.

Of course, it is still possible to override a preference value via an attribute when needed.

h5. Size

- @width@ :=
Integer; initially set to @600@.
The width of the player in pixels.
*valid:* integer =:
- @height@ :=
Integer; initially set to @600@.
*Default:* related plugin pref.
The height of the player in pixels. =:
- @ratio@ :=
Integer[@:@]integer, initially no set.
The ratio used to calculate the missing value for the width or the height. =:
- @responsive@ :=
@true@ or @false@; initially set to @false@.
Adapts the final player size from the provided width and/or height and/or ratio values to fit the container width.
Wraps the player and adds some styles.
The related preference is a generic oui_player preference; it is applied to all providers or none. =:

h5. Parameters

- @type@ :=
@simple@ or @postcard@, initially set to @simple@.
Set the player type. =:
- @audio@ :=
@0@ or @1@; initially set to @0@.
Enable sound. =:

h3. oui_if_vine vs oui_if_player

p. While the @<txp:oui_if_player>…</txp:oui_if_player>@ tag is able to check an URL against any URL from any extension-related provider, the @<txp:oui_if_vine>…</txp:oui_if_vine>@ tag is a shortcut to check an URL against Vine related URL schemes only. It is strictly equivalent to @<txp:oui_if_player provider="vine">…</txp:oui_if_player>@.

Check the "oui_player":https://github.com/NicolasGraph/oui_player documentation for more informations.

h2. Examples
